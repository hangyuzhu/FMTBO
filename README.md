# Federated Many-Task Bayesian Optimization
 
This is the code implementation of our paper "Federated Many-Task Bayesian Optimization". You can find the paper through the early access [TEVC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141991])

## Quick Start
You can easily run the code by .sh files in the folder of experiments.

sh mtp.sh: FHS, FHS-FEI

sh mtpkt.sh: FHS-KT, FMTBO

## Non-IID simulations
Remove the argument --iid and set --np_per_dim for number of partitions per feature dimension

## SOP
Contain bencmark single objective problems: **Griewank, Rastrigin, Ackley, Schwefel, Sphere, Rosenbrock, Weierstrass, Ellipsoid**

## Multi/Many Task problems
The sythetic many-task problems include 18 tasks generated by rotation and shift matrices.
